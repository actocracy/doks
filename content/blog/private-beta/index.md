# Actocracy's Closed Beta: Pioneering the Future Together

Actocracy is thrilled to announce the commencement of our closed Beta testing phase on this 1st day of March.

This significant step is not just a testament to our technological advancements but a beacon of our shared vision for a future where every voice matters and every action counts.


## Key Updates

During this Beta testing phase, we've implemented several significant updates to enhance the platform's functionality and security:

- **Core Microservices Refactoring**: We've thoroughly refactored all core microservices to ensure the highest security standards. All potential security breaches have been addressed, risks mitigated, and attack vectors rendered too costly or impossible, safeguarding your private data comprehensively.

- **Revamped Campaigns Section**: The /campaigns section has received a new UI/UX design, enabling advertisers to track the activities of Campaigns' Quests effectively and in real-time.

- **Contract Audits**: Our Token, Swap, and Internal Exchange contracts have undergone rigorous third-party audits, ensuring their integrity and security. You can review the audit results on PolygonScan:

  - [Token Contract](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x1a5d8d590dda6c45e4469cd32a4c777079409711#readContract)

  - [Swap Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xa9886211C31dc81FB1AD11Ee1CA8ad96F0Da0D8f#readContract)

  - [Internal Exchange Contract](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xBe0E49146A1C85185ba227194A787e7dC4F246A7#readContract)

- **DIMP Token Liquidity and Safety**: The DIMP token can now be transferred and swapped directly in MetaMask and other wallets supporting UniswapV3, ensuring user funds are absolutely safe and accessible, even if Actocracy is offline.

- **AI-Powered Activity Approval**: Our newly released Activity Approval AI is in its learning phase, double-checking the organicness of user activities to provide the best possible experience. This includes real-time checks during quest completions and post-factum statistical analyses.

- **Liquidity Provision**: Initial liquidity has been provided to DIMP token swap pairs for DIMP/USDT and DIMP/USDC pools.

- **Promotion Helper and Strategy Builder**: Our AI-powered promotion helper and auto-promotion-strategy builder are now in the prototype stage and undergoing testing.
